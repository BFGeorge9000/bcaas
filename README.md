## BeneWHOCumberWHAT-as-a-Service (BCaaS)

A while back, a chat room conversation with some coworkers turned to crafting creative permutations of an English actor's name. That weekend, I threw together a tongue-in-cheek name generator that still lives at [BeneWHOcumberWHAT](https://benewhocumberwhat.herokuapp.com).

The original application was built in [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), to serve up a website in hopes of driving some traffic to an array of relevant Amazon referral links. Despite my best online marketing efforts, the referral links failed to make any money. I did learn a valuable lesson, though - *I'm a terrible online marketer.*

Fast forward to today; I find myself working with APIs more often than anything else, on a project that has me doing more visual programming than typing. While an enjoyable and varied challenge, I wanted to keep my skills sharp. As such, *BCaaS* was born - a [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/) rewrite of the original RoR application, with the sole purpose of serving up its data over API.
